      <h3>  Hi, welcome to my website. My name is Josephine and I was born in Manhattan on May 11, 2000 as the youngest of 4. However, I lived in Brooklyn all my life. I am a rising senior at Midwood High School at Brooklyn College. In my free time, I love exploring the city with my friends and trying new foods with my sisters. Over the summer, I love running early in the morning with my friends. But I love volunteering all year round!!</h3>
      <h3>But let's talk food! Ever since I was young, I loved eating candy, especially Dum Dum Lollipops. As shown in the picture below on the right, I stained the corner of my mouth with a blue raspberry dum dum. I still love eating candy, especially pink starbursts and watermelon jolly ranchers! It keeps me awake and energetic. But for meals, I could go days only eating chicken, potatoes, or sushi. I love love love chicken so much, especially chicken nuggets. I'm always asked which fast food chicken nugget is my favorite, but I don't have a favorite because they're all chicken nuggets!! But just because I love eating chicken and sushi, it doesn't mean I dislike eating vegetables. I could eat a bowl of steamed broccoli or squash.</h3>
      <h3> When I was younger, I really enjoyed running up and down stairs. But whenever I wasn't running down the stairs, I was sliding down! I guess you could say, I've loved adrenaline rushes since I was 4 years old. Unlike most people, I find joy in going on roller coasters and water rides! </h3>
